Short Bio
===
I am a fourth-year PhD candidate at The University of Hong Kong (HKU) supervised by [Prof. Jia Pan](https://sites.google.com/site/panjia/). Currently, my research focuses on utilizing robotic proprioceptive and exteroceptive sensing to achieve recognition and manipulation of granular materials (GMs).

In addition, I have a wide range of research interests that involve the applications of serial, parallel, and mobile robots. My works include advancements in multi-robot system (AGVs) scheduling and control, path planning, collision detection for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), as well as modeling for cable-driven parallel robots (CDPRs).

I worked as an intern in the RAL (Robotics and Autonomous Driving Lab) at [Baidu Research](http://research.baidu.com/) and as an algorithm engineer at [HikRobot](https://www.hikrobotics.com/en).
