Short Bio
===
I am Zeqing (aka Benji) Zhang, the Research Fellow at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), collaborating with [Prof. Lihua Xie](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/elhxie/). Before that, I did postdoctoral training at The University of Hong Kong (HKU), closely working with [Prof. Jia Pan](https://www.cs.hku.hk/people/academic-staff/jpan).

Prior to this, I completed my PhD at HKU under the distinguished supervision of [Prof. Jia Pan](https://sites.google.com/site/panjia/) and [Prof. Wenping Wang](https://www.cs.hku.hk/people/academic-staff/wenping), whose guidance has been instrumental in shaping my research trajectory.

My current research interests focus on using robotic proprioceptive and exteroceptive sensing for the perception and manipulation of soft bodies (e.g., garments) and granular media (e.g., sands). I primarily work with vision, touch, force sensing and natural  language prompts to handle these nonlinear materials.

Additionally, I have diverse interests in applications involving serial robots, parallel robots, and mobile robots. My early work includes planning and coordination for multi-robot systems of AGVs, collision detection for UAVs, and fundamental problems in parallel robots.

I previously interned at the Robotics and Autonomous Driving Lab (RAL) at [Baidu Research](http://research.baidu.com/) and worked as an algorithm engineer at [HikRobot](https://www.hikrobotics.com/en). I visited the [Harada Lab](https://www.roboticmanipulation.org/english/) at Osaka University (2024), [Prof. Jiajun Wu](https://jiajunwu.com/#group)'s group at Stanford University (2025).
