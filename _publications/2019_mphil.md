title: "Ray-based Interference Free Workspace Analysis and Path Planning for Cable-Driven Robots"
abstract: "This thesis studies the interference-free workspace (IFW) of arbitrary cable-driven robots (CDRs) for both cables and obstacles using ray-based method, followed by the point-to-point path planning and verification technique to ensure that the resulting motion is within the workspace. <br/><img src='/images/publications/2019_mphil.jpg'>"
