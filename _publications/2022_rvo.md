title: "Reinforcement learned distributed multi-robot navigation with reciprocal velocity obstacle shaped rewards"
abstract: "In this letter, we propose a distributed approach, RL-RVO, for multi-robot navigation combining reciprocal velocity obstacle (RVO) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to solve the reciprocal collision avoidance problem under limited information. <br/><img src='/images/publications/2022_rvo.jpg'>"
