title: "Collaborative Assembly Policy Learning of a Sightless Robot"
abstract: "This paper explores a physical human-robot collaboration (pHRC) task involving the joint insertion of a board into a frame by a sightless robot and a human operator. Here we propose a novel RL approach that utilizes a human-designed admittance controller to facilitate more active robot behavior and reduce human effort. <br/><img src='/images/publications/2025_HRI.jpg'>"
