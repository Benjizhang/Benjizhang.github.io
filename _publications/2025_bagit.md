title: "BagIt! An Adaptive Dual-Arm Manipulation of Fabric Bags for Object Bagging"
abstract: "The operation of deformable bags is very common in daily life, such as when the cashier bags products (a). However, this presents significant challenges for robots, mainly resulting from the complex and unpredictable nature of deformable bags (b). This paper proposes an efficient and robust dual-arm system for the task of object bagging by handling the fabric bag (c). <br/><img src='/images/publications/2025_bagit.jpg'>"
