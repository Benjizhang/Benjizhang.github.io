title: "A Joint Learning of Force Feedback of Robotic Manipulation and Textual Cues for Granular Materials Classification"
abstract: "This paper proposes a non-visual classifier, <i>**GmClass**</i>, using the force feedback in the robot-granules interaction. Specifically, we transform the force sequences into the frequency domain and integrate them with high-dimensional textual information into a two-branch architecture for multimodal supervised contrastive learning (MSCL). <br/><img src='/images/publications/2025_gmclass.jpg'>"
