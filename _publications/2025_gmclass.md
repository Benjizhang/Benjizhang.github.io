title: "A Joint Learning of Force Feedback of Robotic Manipulation and Textual Cues for Granular Materials Classification"
abstract: "This paper presents <i>GmClass<i>, a non-visual classifier that utilizes the force feedback from robot-granules interaction, transforms the force sequences into the frequency domain, and integrates them with high-dimensional textual information within a two-branch architecture for multimodal supervised contrastive learning (MSCL). <br/><img src='/images/publications/2025_gmclass.jpg'>"
